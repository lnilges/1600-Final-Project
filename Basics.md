# Binary Basics

**Definition:** binary is a numerical system that uses only two digits (0, 1), to represent values. It is the foundation of all computing systems. 

### Number Systems
There are four common types of number systems used:
- Base-2: Binary is a base-2 number system because it only uses the numbers 0 and 1. Binary is used for computing and digital systems.
- Base-8: Known as the octal number system and uses numbers 0-7. Octal is used in some computing systems because it can represent large binary numbers in a more compact format.
- Base-10: Known as the decimal number system and uses numbers 0-9. Decimal is used for everyday counting, measuring, and arithmetic expressions. 
- Base-16: Known as the hexadecimal number systems and uses number 0-9 and letters A-F. Hexadecimal is used in computing and digital systems for memory addressing, color coding, error codes, and data representation.

### Why is Binary Important?
Binary plays a critical role in computing because it is the basis of binary digits, or bits, which are the most basic unit of information in a computer. Binary allows computers to efficiently store and manipulate data and it can represent various different types of digital data including text, numbers, images, and sound. Binary makes it possible for computers to communicate, perform calculations, and store information. Binary works well because computers operate using electrical signals, on (1) and off (0). 

When using binary, each digit can either be a 1 or a 0. Counting binary numbers is similar to counting decimal number where when one digit reaches its maximum value, another digit is added to the left side. 

### Applications of Binary
Binary is used in many applications such as:
- Computer Processors: use binary to perform arithmetic and logical operations
- File Compression & Decompression: compression algorithms use binary code to represent the data in a more compact form to reduce the amount of storage space required
- Cryptography: binary is used in cryptography for encryption, decryption, and authentication
- Digital Audio & Video Processing: audio and video files are encoded as streams of binary data
- Machine Learning & AI: machine learning and artificial intelligence models like neural networks use binary
